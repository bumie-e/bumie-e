### Hi there ðŸ‘‹.

I'm Bunmi Akinremi a Machine Learning Engineer at Rural farmers Hub - helping farmers by building sustainable solutions leveraging AI and GIS. I have keen research interests in Computer Vision, Causal Inference, Environmental and Climate change. I'm helping NGOs by providing a sustainable solution built with Drones and Computer Vision to help cleanup activities. I have received multiple recognitions for my AI contributions and community-building spirit in the Miss Algorithm 2021 award by DSN. I currently leads a Women in Data Science Community with a mission to help women build data careers, and manage a Microsoft Campus Tech Community.


- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on research papers in Computer Vision and Causal Inference
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Computer Vision for space art generation
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about how Causal Inference can improve business decision making
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about AI/ML, Climate Change, and GIS(I'll try) 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I write poems and I'm interested in finance and entrepreneurship ecosystem.
